    <h1>Welcome to the site!</h1>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, I have not had much time to work on it, so for right now, this is all that is here. What I would like to have is a landing page, a portfolio page, a projects page, an about page and a contact me page. Well, I guess this is the beginnings of a landing page. Let's see how this works out.

        One of the things I would love to do in the future is to take some of my side projects and finish them. My master's degree in software engineering takes priority and after that and work, I don't have much free time.
