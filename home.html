    <h3>AI Shell</h3>
    <p>Role(s): Software Engineer</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/alyons/AI-Shell--C--" target="_blank">AI Shell</a> is something I crafted partially working on a few projects from school, which crystallized while working on Lume. We use this to test data against goals users set within Lume. I am also looking to use it in other porjects in the future.</p>

    <h3>Automated Build and Testing</h3>
    <p>Role(s): Author</p>
    <p>This is a <a href="AutomatedBuildAndTesting.pdf">paper</a> I wrote for a software engineering course based around process and process improvement. While we have not been able to implement the automated build and testing for Lume, we are always looking to improve our process in any way we can.</p>
